# tensorflow-examples
The goal of this repository is to provide a set of simple-to-understand examples of different deep learning architectures implemented using Google TensorFlow.  Each script in the repository is a self-contained example illustrating a different applied to the MNIST dataset.  
So far, this includes:  
1. Convolutional neural network
2. Auto-encoder
3. Convolutional auto-encoder
4. Generative adversarial neural network
