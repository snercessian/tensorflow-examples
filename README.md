# tensorflow-examples
The goal of this repository is to provide a set of simple-to-understand examples of different deep learning architectures implemented using Google TensorFlow.  Each Python script in the repository is a fully self-contained example applied to the MNIST dataset.  

The repository includes (so far):  
1. Convolutional neural network
2. Auto-encoder
3. Convolutional auto-encoder
4. Denoising convolutional auto-encoder
5. Generative adversarial neural network
