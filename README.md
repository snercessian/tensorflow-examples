# tensorflow-examples
The goal of this repository is to provide a set of simple-to-understand examples of different deep learning architectures implemented using Google TensorFlow.  Each Python script in the repository is a fully self-contained example applied to the MNIST dataset.  

The repository includes:  
1. Convolutional neural network (CNN): [code](cnn.py)
2. Auto-encoder (AE): [code](ae.py)
3. Convolutional auto-encoder (CAE): [code](cae.py)
4. Denoising convolutional auto-encoder (DCAE): [code](dcae.py)
5. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN): [code](gan.py)
6. Super-resolution using CNN: [code](superres_cnn.py)
7. Deep convolutional generative adversarial neural network (DCGAN): (coming soon)
8. Super-resolution using DCGAN: (coming soon)
9. Recurrent neural network (for classification): (coming soon)
10. Recurrent neural network (for forecasting): (coming soon)
